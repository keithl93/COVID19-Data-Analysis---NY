# COVID19-Data-Analysis---NY

Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is the most significant health disaster that has affected the world since
its outbreak in early 2020. Since it is a contagious disease by the virus, the spread is entirely dependent on
the human interactions. Reducing the chances of infection by wearing a mask, avoiding close distance from
others, practicing good hygiene, and others have been a practice of life.
In this project, the data of COVID-19 pandemic in USA from January 2020 till present has been analyzed
to examine the statistical distributions. The historical data of the coronavirus cases and deaths for each
geography was included in the data. By analyzing it, the specific times and locations for the most incidences
were examined. This analysis can also show which locations in the US are more prone to contagious disasters.

Packages Required
Packages with useful collection of functions were loaded in order to reproduce the code and results. They were
standard packages used for tidying and analyzing the data. Packages for formatting the data visualization
were also loaded.

Tidying Data
Separate objects of datasets selected by groups of dates were created, including months which was extracted
from the date, and by states. The datasets for the cases and deaths were accumulated for different groups:
- incidences by year - incidences by month and year - incidences in each county - incidences in each state by
month - incidences in each state by year

Exploratory Data Analysis
The pre-processed data was analyzed to calculate the statistical distribution of the cases and deaths by the
groups. Firstly, the cases and deaths in the US from the beginning were visualized.


Summary
After analyzing the COVID-19 pandemic data for the US, more details about the cases and deaths was
understood. Firstly, the trend was examined over time and to see what are the frequent times of the year for
most incidences. The line graph clearly showed that the highest jumps were during the new year time. The
holiday season during the end of the year appeared to have the highest number of cases within the timeline.
Looking back at the table comparing the number of cases within each month between the years, the largest
difference occurred during New Year’s time of 2021. The New Year’s of 2020 was the second largest and it
was only half. The trends become more linear after the holiday season. This last holiday season appeared
better than previous. The descriptive statistics was also calculated and it showed that the cases and deaths
increased exponentially over the years. The states in the US with the highest sum of cases were the following
ranked from the top: California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Illinois. Starting from the least sums, they
were American Samoa, Northern Marinara Islands, Virgun Islands, Guam, and Vermont. The data was then
filtered to New York state and the 5 counties with the most cases and least cases were examined. Counties
with the most cases were New York City, Suffolk, Nassau, Westchester, and Erie, ranked descending. The
least cases occurred in Hamilton, Schuyler, Yates, and Schoharie, ranked ascending.
